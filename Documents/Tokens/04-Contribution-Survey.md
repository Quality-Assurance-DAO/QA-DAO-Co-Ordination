## DAO-Contribution-Survey

**The key approach is to capture contributions first and assess value last.** 

Why ? Because value led models typically dictate the nature of contributions e.g. a financial incentive contribution model will ten to favor immediate returns, an equal share of rewards upfront will penalize those who have contributed more than others etc.

A contribution led model either tracks or audits DAO member contributions first. Then rewards (in ADA) or recognition (in a Token) are applied to the contribution data.

## Identity

**This survey encourages DAO members to identify themselves as it provides a record of their contribution.**

However a anon ID option should be available and peer reviewed per work area.

## General Information

This provides an overall summary or context of a member, when they became involved and how many days they have worked.
This could be supplemented with a contribution vote by peers to capture the more intangible contribution a member has made.
