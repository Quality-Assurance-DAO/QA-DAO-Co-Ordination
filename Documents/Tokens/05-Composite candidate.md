## Background

The length of tenure for a nominee is three months and the period between meetings is two weeks.

## Fractal governance is our Swarm platform

A Composite Candidate comprised of two individuals nominated and supported by the Catalyst Swarm community in the form of a two sub-circle structure.

## A Two Sub-Circle Support Structure

- To develop, support and enrich the nomination process

- To reduce unnecessary competition in favor of a co-operative approach.

- To supply necessary resources to nominees

- To gain the acceptance of community

- To support the political education of nominees

- To provide a robust and redundant system that reproduces itself.
