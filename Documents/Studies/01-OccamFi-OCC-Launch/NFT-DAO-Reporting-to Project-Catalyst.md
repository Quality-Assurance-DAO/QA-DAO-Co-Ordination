NFT-DAO Reporting to Project Catalyst 

To Project Catalyst Moderator Team

In accordance with Project Catalyst’s Community Moderation Guidelines, I am “leading by action” and am writing with reference to NFT-DAO’s reporting to Project Catalyst. I submit that the reporting of the Fund 3 proposal Comprehensive NFT Framework Collab has been inaccurate, and misleading to the Project Catalyst community (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Comprehensive-NFT-Framework-Collab/334521-48088#idea-tab-comments). 
Since April 2021, the following events have not been reflected in NFT-DAO’s public reports:

1)	A unilateral decision was made by the original proposers of the Comprehensive NFT Framework Collab to join OccamFi’s “Hackathon”, without consulting NFT-DAO’s core contributors. This decision was presented as a fait accompli to NFT-DAO’s Governance group. The “Hackathon” was actually a submission to a funding vetting process.
2)	The entire core Development team left in May 2021, and this fact has not yet been fully communicated to NFT-DAO members. Nor have the reasons for their departure been documented in Project Catalyst reporting.
3)	Concerns which have been raised in meetings about the proposed partnership with OccamFi were initially treated by NFT-DAO proposers in a way that felt dismissive. These concerns focused on the fact that OccamFi, in its consultancy with NFT-DAO for funding, would demand proprietary working methods from NFT-DAO, which would mean the Comprehensive NFT Framework Collab is not an “open-source composable NFT framework” as stated in the proposal.
4)	The above events have led to two members of NFT-DAO’s Governance group ceasing any further involvement with NFT-DAO.
5)	Details about OccamFi’s deal with NFT-DAO (for example its valuation of NFT-DAO, and the amount of funding it is offering in return for what percentage of NFT-DAO) have not been communicated to members or core contributors.
6)	In preparation for a OccamFi AMA (Ask Me Anything), several questions were collated from members of NFT-DAO. Members’ trust in this AMA was then undermined because the host was not neutral, stated his support for the deal, and characterised the questions as “overly aggressive”.

 
A key factor in causing this situation may be that NFT-DAO has not yet agreed a charter/constitution, a group decision-making process, a code of conduct or a contributions policy. Members do “assume good intent” as per moderation guidelines; but without these things in place, decentralized governance is more difficult to achieve.
The members (the “implementers”) who have left NFT-DAO have contributed substantial work that is unrewarded (“Recognize and credit where it is due”), and have left, as a group, for reasons that should be captured by the Catalyst reporting process.
I fully support Project Catalyst’s experimental approach, but an experiment is only useful if it fully represents what has happened. The events detailed here are not adequately represented in NFT-DAO’s reports to Project Catalyst.

It would be appreciated if you could respond to these concerns before the next Catalyst Townhall on 26th May 2021, so that members who have left, and those who are yet to contribute, may be assured of full transparency in respect of the Comprehensive NFT Framework Collab proposal.

Yours sincerely
 Stephen Whitenstall

I have been part of NFT-DAO Governance since the beginning of March 2021, built up the project’s documentation, maintained its GitHub repositories, conducted governance token research & development and trained/mentored members. I helped draft the “NFT-DAO EZ-Honor contribution token proposal” with Troy Egan and Dan Verowski and am a co-proposer and GitHub repo maintainer for the “NFTDAO: Industry Standards 1 proposal”. I also feature in two NFT-DAO Youtube videos on “Governance & Contribution Token” and “Standards”. I have my own Fund 5 proposal “QA-DAO” and now contribute to two other Catalyst projects.
