# Welcome to DAO-Open-Source GitHub Training

## Overview

Here we aim to :

Reduce barriers of entry to GitHub use.
Encourage participation in NFT-DAO's Governance.
Collaborate in developing NFT-DAO's Governance.
Track contributions for token rewards and incentives.

These materials will iteratively develop in the course of training Gov-HOLON members over the next few weeks.

 What works will be kept and refined further.
 What does not work will be recorded as a lesson learnt.

## Sandbox

A GitHub Sandbox Organisation is available at https://github.com/Ek-phrasis/.

Any DAO members may request their own repos with Admin rights which they can play with and break.
Developers

Any developers with GitHub experience are encourgaed to participate by issuing pull requests to add content or raise issues on these training materials.
The beginning
