## Charles Hoskinson, Favorite Philosophers
## Lex Fridman Podcast #192

An extensive interview with Charles Hoskinson by Lex Fridman aired last week. The podcast covers many subjects and lasts over 4 hours. Different topics of conversation are timestamped on Lex Fridman's YouTube channel and well worth a listen.

In this forum post I would like to cover the topic ["Favorite Philosophers"](https://youtu.be/FKh8hjJNhWc?t=434) and provide some references for further reading.

## Favorite Philosophers

Lex starts by quoting Charles as mentioning **Betrand Russell**  ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell), [Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy - SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell/)) and **Saul Kripke** ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Kripke),[The Information Philosopher](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/kripke/)) as "two of your favourite philosophers" and asks Charles to comment on what ideas of theirs he finds insightful.

Charles says that "you can't really talk about Russell and Saul without mentioning Wittgenstein" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein), [SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/), [The Information Philosopher](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/wittgenstein/))
