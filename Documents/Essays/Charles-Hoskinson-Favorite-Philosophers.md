## Charles Hoskinson, Favorite Philosophers
## Lex Fridman Podcast #192

An extensive interview with Charles Hoskinson by Lex Fridman aired last week. The podcast covers many subjects and lasts over 4 hours. Different topics of conversation are timestamped on Lex Fridman's YouTube channel and well worth a listen.
In this forum post I would like to summarise the topic ["Favorite Philosophers"](https://youtu.be/FKh8hjJNhWc?t=434), provide some discussion and references for further reading.

## Favorite Philosophers

Lex starts by quoting Charles as mentioning **Betrand Russell**  ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell), [Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy - SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell/)) and **Saul Kripke** ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Kripke),[The Information Philosopher](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/kripke/)) as "*two of your favourite philosophers*" and asks Charles to comment on what ideas of theirs he finds insightful.

Charles says that "you can't really talk about Russell and Saul without mentioning **Wittgenstein**" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein), [SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/), [The Information Philosopher](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/wittgenstein/))
“And **Tarski**” ([Wikipedia]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Tarski), [SEP]( https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/tarski/)). Together these philosophers increased the level of precision we have in formal languages and language in general. “*Wittgenstein makes no sense at all to me.*” – Charles.

**My commentary** – Wittgenstein in effect founded **logical atomism** with his **Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus** (1921) – the intent of which is stated at the beginning as “The world is the totality of facts, not of things.” Which is referred to as the “Picture Theory of Language”. Later Wittgenstein revised his views (dubbing the Tractus “dogmatic”) and went on to write his “**Philosophical Investigations**” (1951) which introduced the concepts “Meaning as use”, “Language-games”, “Family Resemblance”, “Rule-following”, “Private Language” and “Forms of Life” into analytic philosophy.
