## Communitarianism versus Individualism

One of the first considerations in a designing distributed governance model is where is whether it is to what degree it will be Communitarian or Individualist (or what mix).

## Communitarian 

A communitarian model will - 
- seek to build trust networks (that do rely on human trust)
- rely on non-zero sum games where rewards are evenly distributed
- may fund a positive right such as welfare or UBI
- will try to measure qualitative values such as intangible work 

## Individualism

An Individualist model will -
- seek to build trustless networks (that do not rely on human trust)
- rely on non-zero sum games where rewards are distributed according to contribution
- will uphold the negative right to be free from the burden of contribution to welfare or UBI
- will try to measure quantitative values and leave the qualitative to the individual.
