## Scope :

A Swarm Session is realised by its hosts and participants. It is the hosts and participants who should be rewarded for their contribution.

## Practice:

A treasury is made available for Swarm sessions.

A host takes the initiative to organise, facilitate and moderate a Swarm session. By doing this they nominate themselves as the treasurer of that session. 

What is paid to the host as treasurer is determined by an assessment of the quality of their contribution. This assessment is made by the session participants.

A notional amount is allocated to the session as its maximum reward. A tiered amount is paid out according to the assessment level (e.g. excellent sessions receive 100 % of a session allocation).

The host has a responsibility to reward participants who make key contributions. These contributions must be verifiable by audit. 

## Audit:

Eligible sessions must meet minimum standards. Such as :

- The host follows moderation/facilitation guidelines.
- The session is recorded and/or transcribed (using transcription AIs) 
- The partici√¢nt have to verify their impressions via this form
